PERSONAL LEARNINGS

-Importing JS partials into the Game.js made classes accessible and kept code organized, not having to write everything on a single file.

-Using the New keyword to create instances of the classes setup in other files.

-Understanding how elements are rendered, and how they're neccessary to place SVG items onto the viewport.

-How to manipulate the game setup to fiddle with speed and vectors to make the game more fun and interactive.

-How to create an SVGs HTML.

-How to translate all SVG properties in JS by using setAttributeNS and createElementNS to give the SVG it's shape.

-Using Viewport to set visual canvas to place SVGs.

-Using document.addEventListener to listen for certain key presses.
